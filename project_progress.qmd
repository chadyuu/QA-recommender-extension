## The progress made

1.  Created the Q&A database by preprocessing Q&As from Stack Overflow that relate to text information system.

2.  Implemented a Google Chrome extension that retrieves the three most related Q&As when browsing the content on Stack Overflow.

## Remaining Tasks

1.  Write documenatation.

2.  Create a 5-min tutorial presentation.

    1.  how to install the software

    2.  instructions on how to use the software

    3.  at least one example of use case so as to allow a grader to use the provided use case to test the software

## Challenges/Issues being faced

1.  The calculation of similarity between the current page content and each documents in the Q&A database takes much time because the number of documents is 7319. So I will try to reduce the number of Q&A documents to realize a quick response in this project.
